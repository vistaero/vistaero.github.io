<b>Important notice:</b>
We’ve identified crashes on some devices caused by a Qualcomm graphics driver issue and Samsung’s aggressive battery management.
✅ Recommended fix:
If the game asks you to choose between Vulkan and OpenGL, we recommend selecting OpenGL (it’s more stable on Galaxy S24 for now).
Update to the latest game version.
Go to Settings → Apps → MyGame → Battery → Unrestricted
Go to Settings → Battery → Background usage limits, turn off Put unused apps to sleep, and add MyGame to Apps that won’t be put to sleep
Open the recent apps screen, tap the game’s icon, and select Keep open
Make sure your S24 is up to date: Settings → Software update → Download and install
