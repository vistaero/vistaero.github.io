<br><br>
Step into the incredible world of time and space travel with the Blue Box Simulator, your very own Time And Space machine on your phone! Explore the universe and travel to any planet you desire at superluminal speeds!
<br><br>
With easy-to-use controls, simply tap the screen to access the console and let your adventure begin.
<br><br>
Get ready to experience manual flight like never before! Set the Handbrake to FLIGHT and pull down the Space Throttle to unleash maximum thrust, allowing you to fly around planets and explore the vast expanse of space.
<br><br>
Choose your destination by tapping on a planet icon or entering the coordinates in the menu, and your ship will take off on a thrilling journey through time and space. Adjust your cruise speed with the Space Throttle to take in the stunning sights and sounds of the universe.
<br><br>
Or, if you're feeling adventurous, dematerialize and travel through the Time Vortex by setting the Handbrake to VORTEX and pulling the Space Throttle down to 100. Change your destination while in the vortex and then pull up the Space Throttle to materialize in your new location!
